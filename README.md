This documentation contains a guide for the following:
  1. Setting up docker-open5gs from here: https://github.com/Borjis131/docker-open5gs
  2. Setting up UERANSIM from here: https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM
  3. Configuring docker-open5gs and UERANSIM so that they connect correctly
  4. Configuring docker-open5gs so that it operates in roaming mode
If you see anything that needs change, or if something doesn't work for you let me know so i can update the guide.
